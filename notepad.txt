churn - It refers to the percentage of customers who discontinue their 
relationship with a company over a defined period
"which indicates how many customers leave or stop using a product or service."

========project requirement=========== 
flask - creates our web server
pandas - handles data like Excel
numpy - mathematical operations
scikit-learn - ML algorithms (LogisticRegression, RandomForest)
xgboost - advanced ML algorithm
        (eXtreme Gradient Boosting) is a powerful, open-source library providing a 
        highly efficient and optimized implementation of gradient-boosted decision trees.

matplotlib/seaborn - create charts and graphs
joblib - saves and loads trained models



***********---------------dataset-----------------**************
**Action 3: Understand the dataset**

Let me explain what each column means (this is what banks track about customers):

**Customer Information:**
- `CustomerId` - unique ID for each customer
- `Surname` - customer's last name
- `Geography` - country (France, Spain, Germany)
- `Gender` - Male or Female
- `Age` - customer's age

**Financial Information:**
- `CreditScore` - credit rating (300-850, higher is better)
- `Balance` - account balance in dollars
- `EstimatedSalary` - yearly income
- `NumOfProducts` - how many bank products they have (1-4)
- `HasCrCard` - does customer have credit card? (1=Yes, 0=No)
- `IsActiveMember` - is customer active? (1=Yes, 0=No)
- `Tenure` - how many years they've been a customer (0-10)

**Target Variable (What we want to predict):**
- `Exited` - did customer leave the bank? (1=Yes/Churned, 0=No/Stayed)



--------------------------------------------------------------------

Before building ML models, we need to understand our data:

Check for missing values
See data distribution
Understand patterns (Do older customers churn more? Does balance matter?)

This is called Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - every data scientist does this!


*************-------------explore_data---------------------***************
1. Loads the dataset
2. Checks for missing values (empty cells)
3. Shows churn statistics (how many left vs stayed)
4. Analyzes churn patterns by country, gender, age, etc.
5. Creates visualizations (charts) to see patterns visually
6. Gives us key insights about the data



STEP 5: BUILD AND TRAIN ML MODELS

Here, We'll train 3 different ML algorithms and compare which one predicts churn best:

Logistic Regression - Simple, fast, interpretable
Random Forest - More powerful, handles complex patterns
XGBoost - Most advanced, often wins competitions




***************-----------train_model--------------********************

1. Loads the data
2. Converts text to numbers (ML models need numbers)
3. Splits data into training (80%) and testing (20%)
4. Scales features to same range
5. Trains 3 different ML models
6. Evaluates each model with multiple metrics
7. Compares all models and picks the best one
8. Saves all models for later use
9. Creates visualization charts
10. Explains what each metric means



------------------BACKEND SERVER----------------------

1. Loads our trained ML model
2. Receives customer data from the frontend
3. Makes predictions (will customer churn?)
4. Sends prediction back to the frontend

    Think of it as the "brain" of our web app!
